;;; ox-leanpub-book.el --- Export an org-file to LeanPub's multifile setup  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Copyright (C) 2019  Zamboni Diego

;;; Author: Zamboni Diego <diego@zzamboni.org>
;;; Keywords: org, leanpub

;;; Commentary:

;;; (based originally on code by Lakshmi Narasimhan, published at
;;; https://medium.com/@lakshminp/publishing-a-book-using-org-mode-9e817a56d144,
;;; but heavily modified)
;;;
;;; New export backend called leanpub-book, which creates a new
;;; export section called "LeanPub Book" with the following items:
;;;
;;; - "Multifile Export", which exports the whole book using default
;;;   settings (see below);
;;;
;;; - "Multifile Export (subset)", which creates only the Subset.txt file;
;;;
;;; - "Export current chapter" to explicitly export only the current
;;;   chapter to its own file. This also updates Subset.txt, so it can be
;;;   used to preview the current chapter without having to set
;;;   `#+LEANPUB_WRITE_SUBSET: current'.
;;;
;;; The export splits chapters into files by top-level headline, and
;;; automatically populates the `Book.txt', `Sample.txt' and
;;; `Subset.txt' files used by LeanPub.
;;;
;;; The exported files are written to the `manuscript/' subdirectory
;;; by default, which is what LeanPub expects. This default allows
;;; you to keep the book's main `org' file in the top-level directory
;;; of a repository, and to automatically write the output files to
;;; `manuscript/' so that LeanPub can process them. The output
;;; directory can be changed using the `#+LEANPUB_OUTPUT_DIR' file
;;; property, for example if you want to export to the current
;;; directory, you can use:
;;;
;;;   #+LEANPUB_OUTPUT_DIR: .
;;;
;;; The book files are populated as follows:
;;;
;;; - `Book.txt' with all chapters, except those tagged with `noexport'.
;;; - `Sample.txt' with all chapters tagged with `sample'.
;;; - `Subset.txt' with chapters depending on the value of the
;;;   `#+LEANPUB_WRITE_SUBSET' file property (if set):
;;;   - `none' (default): not created.
;;;   - `tagged': use all chapters tagged `subset'.
;;;   - `all': use the same chapters as `Book.txt'.
;;;   - `sample': use same chapters as `Sample.txt'.
;;;   - `current': export the current chapter (where the cursor is at the
;;;     moment of the export) as the contents of `Subset.txt'.
;;;
;;; If a heading has the `frontmatter', `mainmatter' or `backmatter' tags,
;;; the corresponding markup is inserted in the output, before the
;;; headline. This way, you only need to tag the first chapter of the
;;; front, main, and backmatter, respectively.
;;;
;;; Each section's headline is exported as part of its corresponding
;;; output file.
